# RockPaperScissors

Welcome to my first Python project!

This is a basic Rock Paper Scissors game that tracks your score! After you start the program, it won't stop the game until you give the input d.

Please, be sure to test it out and give me feedback, being that I'm starting to learn Python now! :)
